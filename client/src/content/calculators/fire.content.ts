    content: `A FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) calculator helps you determine the exact corpus you need to achieve financial independence and potentially retire early. It's based on the proven "25x Rule" which states that you need 25 times your annual expenses invested to safely retire and live off your investment returns indefinitely.

**Why it matters:** Traditional retirement planning assumes you'll work until 60-65. The FIRE movement recognizes that with disciplined saving and strategic investing, you can achieve financial independence much earlier—potentially in your 40s or even 30s. This calculator quantifies your FIRE number and creates a roadmap to get there, transforming retirement from a distant dream into an achievable near-term goal.`,

    title: "How Can RuDo's FIRE Calculator Help You?",
    content: `The FIRE calculator does three critical things: calculates your FIRE number (the corpus you need), determines how much you need to save monthly to reach it, and projects your timeline to financial independence. It removes the mystery from early retirement and provides a concrete, actionable plan.

For NRIs, especially those in high-income markets like UAE, USA, or Singapore, FIRE is particularly achievable due to higher savings rates and lower tax burdens. This calculator helps you leverage your NRI advantage to potentially retire a decade or more before peers in India.

**Key Benefits:**
• **Know Your Number:** Calculate exact corpus needed based on your lifestyle and annual expenses
• **Timeline Projection:** See when you can achieve financial independence based on current savings rate
• **Savings Rate Impact:** Understand how increasing your savings rate dramatically accelerates FIRE
• **Withdrawal Strategy:** Model safe withdrawal rates (typically 4%) to ensure corpus sustainability
• **Scenario Planning:** Test different expense levels, return rates, and savings patterns
• **Gap Analysis:** Identify shortfall between current trajectory and desired FIRE timeline
• **Multi-Currency Planning:** Calculate FIRE number accounting for NRI cross-border scenarios
• **Lifestyle Design:** Visualize different FIRE variants (Lean FIRE, Fat FIRE, Barista FIRE)`,

    title: 'How Does the FIRE Calculator Work?',
    content: `The FIRE calculator is built on the scientifically-backed "25x Rule" derived from the Trinity Study, which analyzed historical market data to determine safe withdrawal rates:

**The 25x Rule:**
\`\`\`
FIRE Number = Annual Expenses × 25
\`\`\`

This is based on the 4% safe withdrawal rule: if you withdraw 4% of your corpus annually (adjusted for inflation), your investments will sustain you indefinitely with 95% confidence based on historical data.

**Example Calculation:**

**Step 1: Calculate Annual Expenses**
Current monthly expenses: ₹1,00,000
Annual expenses: ₹12,00,000

**Step 2: Calculate FIRE Number**
FIRE Number = ₹12,00,000 × 25 = ₹3,00,00,000 (₹3 Crores)

**Step 3: Calculate Required Monthly Investment**
Current age: 30
Target FIRE age: 45 (15 years away)
Expected return: 12% per annum

Using SIP formula to reach ₹3 crores in 15 years:
Required Monthly SIP ≈ ₹59,850

**Step 4: Calculate Savings Rate**
If monthly income is ₹2,50,000:
Savings rate = ₹59,850 / ₹2,50,000 = 23.9%

**Alternative Scenarios:**
• **Lean FIRE:** Reduce expenses to ₹60,000/month → FIRE Number: ₹1.8 Crores → Monthly SIP: ₹35,900 → Achievable in 15 years
• **Fat FIRE:** Maintain ₹1,50,000/month expenses → FIRE Number: ₹4.5 Crores → Monthly SIP: ₹89,775 → Requires higher income or longer timeline

**The 4% Withdrawal Rule:**
Once you reach ₹3 crores, you can safely withdraw ₹12 lakhs annually (₹1 lakh monthly) without depleting your corpus, assuming 7-8% post-retirement returns (inflation-adjusted 4%).`,

    title: 'How to Use RuDo\'s FIRE Calculator?',
    content: `Using our FIRE calculator helps you create a personalized roadmap to financial independence:

**Step 1: Calculate Your Annual Expenses**
Track your current annual spending. Include everything: housing, food, transportation, healthcare, entertainment, insurance. Be realistic—underestimating leads to insufficient corpus.

**Pro tip:** Use 80% of current expenses if you plan to relocate to lower cost-of-living area post-FIRE (e.g., NRIs returning to India).

**Step 2: Determine Your FIRE Number**
The calculator multiplies your annual expenses by 25 to give your FIRE number. This is the corpus that generates enough returns to cover expenses indefinitely.

**Step 3: Set Your Current Age and Target FIRE Age**
When do you want to achieve financial independence? The gap determines your investment timeline:
• Aggressive: 10-15 years (requires high savings rate 40-60%)
• Moderate: 15-20 years (requires savings rate 25-40%)
• Conservative: 20-25 years (requires savings rate 15-25%)

**Step 4: Input Expected Returns**
For long-term FIRE accumulation, equity-heavy portfolios averaging 10-12% are realistic. For post-FIRE sustenance, plan for conservative 7-8% (inflation-adjusted 4%).

**Step 5: Review Required Monthly Investment**
The calculator shows monthly SIP needed. Compare this with your current income to determine required savings rate.

**Step 6: Optimize Your Plan**
If required savings rate is too high:
• Extend FIRE timeline by 3-5 years
• Reduce post-FIRE expense budget
• Increase income sources
• Consider hybrid FIRE (part-time work + investments)

If you're ahead of target:
• Accelerate FIRE timeline
• Build larger corpus for Fat FIRE lifestyle
• Create multiple passive income streams

**Step 7: Account for Existing Savings**
Input current investment corpus. The calculator adjusts required monthly SIP accordingly, leveraging your head start.

**NRI-Specific Considerations:**
• Calculate expenses in country where you'll retire (often India for NRIs)
• Factor in exchange rate assumptions if retiring cross-border
• Account for healthcare costs in target retirement country
• Consider visa/residency status impacts on withdrawal strategy`,

    title: 'Advantages of FIRE Planning',
    content: `**1. Life Freedom and Flexibility**
Financial independence means work becomes optional. Pursue passion projects, volunteer, travel, or simply enjoy life without financial stress.

**2. Escape Corporate Rat Race**
Break free from job dependencies, office politics, and golden handcuffs. True freedom to choose how you spend your time.

**3. Geographic Flexibility**
NRIs achieving FIRE can choose where to live based on lifestyle preference rather than job location—whether that's India, UAE, Europe, or Southeast Asia.

**4. Early Health Enjoyment**
Retire in your 40s when you're still healthy and energetic enough to truly enjoy life, rather than waiting until 60-65 when health often declines.

**5. Recession-Proof Life**
With 25x corpus generating income, you're immune to job losses, industry downturns, or company closures. True financial security.

**6. Family Time**
Be present for children's growing years, aging parents' needs, or simply have time for relationships that matter most.

**7. Pursue Meaningful Work**
Post-FIRE, you can take up lower-paying but personally fulfilling work without financial pressure—teaching, arts, social work, startups.

**8. Compound Discipline Benefits**
The discipline required for FIRE (high savings rate, intentional spending) creates healthy financial habits that benefit you regardless of when you achieve FIRE.

**9. Reduced Life Stress**
Knowing you have a concrete plan and timeline to financial independence dramatically reduces daily work stress and burnout.

**10. Downside Protection**
Even if you don't "retire early," achieving your FIRE number provides ultimate financial security and flexibility for career changes.

**11. Particularly Powerful for NRIs**
NRIs in UAE, USA, Singapore often have:
• Higher incomes (40-60% more than India-based peers)
• Lower tax rates (especially UAE with 0% personal tax)
• Stronger currencies for investing in INR assets
• Lower cost of living post-retirement if returning to India

This combination makes FIRE achievable in 12-15 years versus 20-25 years for India-based professionals.

**12. Legacy Building**
FIRE corpus continues growing post-retirement, creating generational wealth for children and grandchildren.`,

**Goal Planning Calculator**
Break down your FIRE journey into intermediate milestones—first ₹50 lakhs, then ₹1 crore, etc. Track progress and stay motivated.

**Step-Up SIP Calculator**
As your income grows (especially for NRIs with rapid salary progression), stepping up SIP contributions annually can accelerate FIRE by 3-5 years.

**SIP Calculator**
Model different monthly investment amounts to see impact on FIRE timeline. Often, increasing SIP by just ₹10,000/month can advance FIRE by 2-3 years.

**Lumpsum Calculator**
Calculate impact of investing bonuses, RSUs, or windfalls as lumpsum toward your FIRE goal. Each ₹10 lakh lumpsum can reduce FIRE timeline by 1-2 years.

**PPF Calculator**
While PPF alone won't achieve FIRE (due to lower returns and contribution limits), it can form the debt portion of your FIRE corpus for stability.

**Currency Impact Calculator**
Critical for NRIs: Model how currency movements affect your FIRE timeline. A strengthening rupee means you need to save more in USD/AED terms; weakening rupee works in your favor.`,
